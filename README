------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements

emacs-perkeep should work with GNU emacs 26.3. And probably also more
recent versions.

emacs-perkeep reads the perkeep configuration from
~/.config/perkeep/client-config.json. It uses the default server
configured there for all interactions with perkeep.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage

emacs-perkeep provides the following functions as major entry points.

perkeep-find-permanode opens a minibuffer which expects a perkeep
expression and will show the found results in a separate buffer. It is
possible to visit permanode content via the found results. Right now
only text files work somehow. The visited permanode buffer will have a
minor mode attached called perkeep-sourced-mode. That minor mode
provides a keymap which will save the buffer on C-x C-s back to the
visited permanode in perkeep.

perkeep-save-buffer can be called on any buffer. It will create a new
permanode in perkeep if the buffer has not yet visited a
permanode. Otherwise the visited permanode's content will be
replaced. The perkeep-sourced-mode minor mode is applied after the
first save of the buffer.

perkeep-persist-claim function is used to produce perkeep claims.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
